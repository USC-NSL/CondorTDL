These are examples of Condor Topology Description Language (TDL) files,
used as illustrations for this paper:

"Condor: Better Topologies through Declarative Design"
Brandon Schlinker (USC, Google), Radhika Niranjan Mysore (Google), 
Sean Smith (Google), Jeffrey C. Mogul (Google), Amin Vahdat (Google), 
Minlan Yu (USC), Ethan Katz-Bassett (USC), Michael Rubin (Google)
in "Proceedings of SIGCOMM 2015."

These files cannot be executed as-is, and the code for the Condor
system itself is not available.

This is not an official Google product (experimental or otherwise), 
it is just code that happens to be owned by Google.
